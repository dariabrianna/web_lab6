## 🎨 Customization

### Styling
All styles are located in the `src/styles/` directory. You can customize:
- Colors and themes
- Card layouts
- Animation effects
- Responsive breakpoints

### Data Structure
The basic task structure:
```javascript
{
  id: "unique-id",
  title: "Task Title",
  description: "Task Description",
  status: "todo" | "inprogress" | "done",
  createdAt: "timestamp"
}
```

## 🔄 State Management

This project uses React's built-in state management with hooks:
- `useState` for component state
- `useEffect` for side effects and data persistence
- `useContext` for global state (if implemented)

## 💾 Data Persistence

Tasks are automatically saved to browser's Local Storage, ensuring your data persists between sessions. The data is loaded when the application starts and saved whenever changes are made.
